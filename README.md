# PayorLedger

A desktop ledger application built with WPF that enables users to log and manage debts. Columns represent loan types, and rows represent loan instances. The application supports easy data entry and provides a clear overview of totals per payor and per loan.

# Project Overview

This project was created to learn Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). I had prior experience with XAML through a previous project built with .NET MAUI, but I noticed that some controls were different or missing in WPF. During this project, I also learned the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, refreshed my knowledge of dependency injection, and implemented services. SQLite was used to store the persistent data.
