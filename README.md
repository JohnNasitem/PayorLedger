# PayorLedger

A desktop ledger application built with WPF that enables users to log and manage debts. Each payor is represented as a row, each loan as a column, and the grid tracks how much each payor owes for each loan. The application supports easy data entry and provides a clear overview of totals per payor and per loan.
