# PayorLedger

A desktop ledger application built with WPF that enables users to log and manage debts. Each payor is represented as a row, each loan as a column, and the grid tracks how much each payor owes for each loan. The application supports easy data entry and provides a clear overview of totals per payor and per loan.

# Project Overview

This project was created to learn Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). I had prior experience with XAML through a previous project built with .NET MAUI, but I noticed that some controls were different or missing in WPF. During this project, I also learned the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern, refreshed my knowledge of dependency injection, and implemented services. SQLite was used to store the persistent data.
